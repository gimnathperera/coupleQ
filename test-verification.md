# Game Flow Verification Test

## âœ… **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Fixed Selection Leakage Issue**

**Problem**: One player's selection was visible to the other player before reveal
**Root Cause**: `isRevealed` was calculated as `Object.keys(revealedOptions).length > 0`, which became `true` as soon as any player locked their answer
**Solution**:

- Added `isRevealed` as a proper prop to `QuestionGrid`
- Now only shows player choices when explicitly revealed via the reveal mechanism
- Player selections remain private until reveal

### **2. Fixed State Management**

**Problem**: Player actions were interfering with each other's state
**Solution**:

- Proper separation of local state (selection) vs server state (locked answers)
- Fixed `isLocked` logic to check current player's lock status correctly
- Removed host-only restriction on reveal button

### **3. Fixed Auto-Reveal and Auto-Advance**

**Problem**: Auto-reveal wasn't working and game wasn't advancing
**Solution**:

- Auto-reveal triggers when both players lock (1 second delay)
- Auto-advance to next round after reveal (3 second delay)
- Both players can manually trigger reveal if auto-reveal fails

## **EXPECTED FLOW NOW:**

### **Phase 1: Selection**

- âœ… Player 1 selects answer â†’ Only Player 1 sees their selection highlighted
- âœ… Player 2 selects answer â†’ Only Player 2 sees their selection highlighted
- âœ… Neither player can see the other's selection

### **Phase 2: Lock**

- âœ… Player 1 clicks "Lock Answer" â†’ Player 1 sees "Locked ðŸ”’", can't change selection
- âœ… Player 2 clicks "Lock Answer" â†’ Player 2 sees "Locked ðŸ”’", can't change selection
- âœ… Neither player can see the other's locked choice

### **Phase 3: Reveal**

- âœ… When both players lock â†’ Auto-reveal triggers after 1 second
- âœ… Both players see each other's choices with avatars
- âœ… Match/mismatch banner appears

### **Phase 4: Next Round**

- âœ… After 3 seconds â†’ Game automatically advances to next round
- âœ… New question loads with fresh state
- âœ… Process repeats

## **TEST SCENARIOS TO VERIFY:**

1. **Privacy Test**:
   - Player 1 selects "Spring" â†’ Player 2 should NOT see "Spring" highlighted
   - Player 2 selects "Summer" â†’ Player 1 should NOT see "Summer" highlighted

2. **Lock Test**:
   - Player 1 locks "Spring" â†’ Player 2 should NOT see "Spring" choice
   - Player 2 locks "Summer" â†’ Player 1 should NOT see "Summer" choice

3. **Reveal Test**:
   - Both players lock â†’ Auto-reveal should happen automatically
   - Both players should see each other's choices simultaneously

4. **Advance Test**:
   - After reveal â†’ Game should advance to next round automatically
   - New round should have fresh state (no previous selections visible)

## **KEY CHANGES MADE:**

1. **QuestionGrid.tsx**:
   - Added `isRevealed` prop
   - Fixed `isLocked` logic to check current player
   - Removed incorrect `isRevealed` calculation

2. **app/r/[code]/page.tsx**:
   - Pass `isRevealed` prop to QuestionGrid
   - Auto-reveal when both players lock
   - Auto-advance after reveal

3. **BottomBar.tsx**:
   - Removed host-only restriction on reveal button
   - Both players can trigger reveal manually

The game should now work correctly with proper privacy, state management, and automated flow! ðŸŽ‰
